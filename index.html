            "There are two Mustafa Kemal's. One is the flesh-and-bone Mustafa Kemal who now stands before you and who will pass away. 
            The other is you, all of you here who will go to the far corners of our land to spread the ideals which must be defended with your lives if necessary.
             I stand for the nation's dreams, and my life's work is to make them come true."
